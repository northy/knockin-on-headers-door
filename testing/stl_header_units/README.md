Using the source code from the mix program in [P2412r0](https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2021/p2412r0.pdf)

Works with:
* MSVC v143 (cl.exe version 19.44.35213)
* gcc 15.2.1 20250808

Partially works with:
* clang version 20.1.8: `clang_import_stdcpp.sh` works, `clang_import_all.sh` doesn't work.
