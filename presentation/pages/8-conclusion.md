## A new baseline

C++ modules shape the future of C++:

- Real encapsulation alongside build improvements
- Standardized importing semantics
- Easier boilerplate + migration
- AI can generate module-first code

<!-- ### Notes:
* The evolution of C++ modules is comparable to constexpr - initial growing pains are expected, but the ecosystem is moving toward more robust, practical tooling.
